" Guilty , said the man in the dock. At this point a man at the back of the court stood up and shouted You dirty rat! The Judge asked the man to site down and to refrain from making any noise. The Judge continued ..... and that also on the 17th September you are accused of killing your son by beating him to death with a hammer, how do you plead ? Guilty , said the man in the dock. Again the same man at the back stood up and shouted even louder, You dirty rotten stinking rat !! At this point the Judge called the man to the bench and said, I have already asked you to be quiet, if you continue with these outbursts, I will have to charge you with contempt of court. I can understand your feelings, but what relationship have you to this man? He replied He is my next door neighbor . The Judge replied, I can understand your feelings then, but you must refrain from any comments . The man replied NO, your Honor, you don't understand. Twice I have asked if I could borrow a hammer, and BOTH TIMES he said he didn't have one !!! Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes üëå",0
"As she rummaged through her dusty belongings, she came across a dull copper kettle. Intrigued by it‚Äôs possible value the old woman dusted it off and BAM! A genie erupted from its neck. The genie says ‚ÄúI have seen your plights, and will grant you three wishes.‚Äù The woman, astounded, thinks for a moment and says ‚Äúage has taken its toll on me. I wish to be young and beautiful once more.‚Äù BAM! In a sudden flash the old woman emerged, a ravishing young woman. Thrilled by her success the woman says ‚Äúgenie I want to live a life of grandeur! To be rich!‚Äù BAM! With a snap of the genies fingers the room swirled and transformed into a great hall. Her once broken cottage had become a mansion. Upon looking down the woman noticed her worn clothing had been replaced with a stunning dress, and shining heels. While she marveled at this outcome the genie stood solemnly and said ‚Äúyou have one wish left.‚Äù The woman thought about this for a while and then felt a slight brush against her leg. It was her old cat, frightened by the buildings transformation. The woman looked up at the genie and said ‚Äúthis cat has been faithfully with me for all my years. Please, transform him into a human man, so that we may spend many happy days together!‚Äù BAM! In a blinding flash the cat had vanished. Standing in his place was a tall, dark-haired, handsome young man. Immediately enamored by her new love, the woman fell into his arms. The genie, his work complete, disappeared. As she gazed into his eyes, he drew her close and whispered ‚ÄúToo bad you had me neutered.‚Äù ",0

Uncle Ted's hiding in your closet and he's got no clothes on! The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door. Sure enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the closet floor.

The next day, the lion is in the bar and the mouse staggers in. The mouse is absolutely ragged, worn out, ruined. The lion helps his pal up onto a stool, pours a drink down his throat and asks, What the hell happened to you? I saw you leave with the giraffe. What happened after that? Was she all right?

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

The man then starts talking to the monk, It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it? he asked. The monk replied religious reasons. The man then says I don't know much about Buddhism, but why do you need to repair fences? Because the monk replied, You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting. ",0

"(Inspired by IT crowd) One gloomy day in London a man by the name of Roy walks in a park, taking a short break from his job in an IT department. Suprisingly, he runs into an old school friend named Alister during his walk, and they catch up. Alister is a local writer for a very famous publishing company, and couldn't stay for long as he had to get back to work. Roy admired his work but didnt get a chance to tell Alister that he worked in IT, showing that he too was successful. He made sure to let him know next time he saw him. After work that day, a window cleaner came by Roy's house and without his consent started cleaning his windows, looking for a tip. Enraged, Roy asked him to get off his property. The man ran away without taking his bicycle and cleaning supplies located in the bike basket. The next day, Roy was running late for work and thought to take this old cleaner bike since he knew a shortcut. During his commute, Alister was walking on a sidewalk and saw Roy zoom past him. Roy saw him as he was zooming past and waved. Alister gave a sort of smug smirk as he waved back, seeing the cleaning supplies and raggedy bike. Since Roy was in a rush he couldn't stop, but he yelled back at him from far away Oh Alister, I am not a window cleaner! He knew he'd run into him again one day and explain the confusion, so he didnt think much of it. A few days pass and this time Roy takes his lunch break to go with a good friend to a private lounge in an area downtown. The music is great, the people are intellectual and Roy starts to imagine that it must be so foolish for Alister to think that he is a window cleaner. His break is almost over and Roy decides to step outside for a breather. He comes out on the roof of the building and walks around, really taking in the view. Roy goes back to the door and attempts to rattle it open, but its locked. He soon realises a mistake was made, as there was no reentry to the building. Panicked, he looks around the roof of the building for a way to get down. He notices a man with a lift to get down on the side, as the man washes the building once a week and so happened to be on his way down. He approaches the man and luckily hitches a ride down. During his descent, Roy spots Alister across the street, drinking a coffee. Roy blindly believes he gets very lucky as he begins to shout from the lift Alister! Alister! Alister looks up and sees Roy descending from the lift with the window cleaner next to him. Alister! I am NOT a window cleaner! As Roy comes down from the lift. Alister looks bewildered and immediately leaves, thinking Roy has gone off his rockers. At this point, the window cleaner next to him gives him a dirty look for mocking his profession. Awkwardness ensues. Roy could not sleep that night. He made it a mission to find Alister and explain all the misunderstandings. He looks him up in the yellow pages and reaches his number. He gives him a call. Alister picks up the phone. Alister, its Roy. Listen, I have to explain myself to you. I am NOT a window cleaner. I am in IT working for a firm in the city. I hope you dont think less of me! Alister calmly responds. IT? that's wonderful. Do you work with macs? Macs? Oh no, I work mainly with Windows. ",0

" A man is fishing on a lake when he catches a fish. The fish says to the fisherman, I'm a magic fish! I since you caught me I have to grant a wish ...But only on one condition. The fisherman asks what the condition is. In order to grant your wishes I need to swim up into your ass, though your asshole. That's how my magic works! I swim up into your asshole, and when I'm in there, shout your wish as loud as you can and my magic will grant the wish! The fisherman thought it over, he didn't like the idea of the fish in his butt, but he could wish for anything he wanted. After some consideration the fisherman accepts the deal. He pulls down his pants and the fish jump up inside the fisherman. The fisherman stood up, shocked from the speed at which the fish jumped, and was even more disturbed way the way the fish thrashed inside. Thinking quickly he shouted I wish for 5 million dollars! . As soon as he shouted his wish the fish shot out and splashed into the pond. The fish swam around to face the shocked fisherman and said Your wish is granted! The money is in your bank-account then swam away under the water. The disturbed fisherman, pulled up his pants and decided to go to the bar for a drink, now that he was a millionaire. When he got there he ordered a round for everyone in the house, however his card got declined due to lack of funds. The fisherman demanded that they try again, as he was a millionaire, the bartender tried again and again, the fisherman's card was declined. The bartender then asked curiously: Why exactly do you think you're a millionaire? By chance were you fishing at the pond nearby? As a matter of fact I was fishing there, how did you know? Said the fisherman. Now... did you happen to catch a talking fish? Yes, I did, and he granted me a wish for 5 million dollars Well, I've got some bad news. That fish is well known around these parts as quite the pervert. He claims to be able to grant wishes, but he can only talk.

" A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began: -The client: is room 39 empty? -The boss: yes, sir. -The client: can I book it? -The boss: of course you can. -The client: thank you. Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g. The boss agreed though he was surprised at the weird things the client asked to have. The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else. Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39. After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor. The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise. In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first. He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table. The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling. The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself. After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle. The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g. This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before. Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face. The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions. The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before. The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before. In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room. -''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?'' -''I promise I will never let anyone know''. -''Swear'' -''I swear I won't reveal your secret'' So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone. When he does, I will let you know... ",0

"Now this parrot was the rudest, noisiest, most foul mouthed parrot you can imagine. Every other word out of this parrot's beak was profanity, and strings of filthy insults - absolutely appalling behaviour! Well, over the course of the next week, John tried speaking to it softy and calmly, playing classical music to it, being very friendly and kind, all in an effort to modify this bird¬¥s language and attitude. It didn¬¥t work. This awful parrot just screamed abuse at him, all day and all night. Finally, after a horrendous day listening to this torrent of filth pouring out of the parrot, I¬¥m afraid John just snapped. He screamed back at the parrot, and of course the parrot screamed louder. He hit the parrot, and of course the parrot bit him. He threw a discarded shoe at the parrot, and naturally the parrot took to the air and shat on him. In a blind rage, John grabbed the parrot by the neck and flung him into the freezer and slammed the door shut. In the glorious peace that followed, John leaned against the kitchen door, panting with the exhaustion and fury of it all, and I have to say it took him several minutes to calm down, and collect his thoughts. That¬¥s when he realised that maybe he¬¥d gone too far, and that he might have actually hurt this parrot - so he cautiously opened the freezer door, and to his surprise the parrot meekly walked out, and sat calmly on John¬¥s outstretched hand. To John¬¥s amazement, the parrot then said I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior. As you might imagine, John was absolutely stunned at this, but before he could even question it, the parrot said May I ask you sir, what the turkey did? MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!",0

"¬† ¬†Even though they could have afforded to live anywhere they wanted, tradition dictated they stay on their tiny island home. Eventually, their king became frustrated and called a meeting of the tribe's elders. He said he wanted them to figure out a way he could enjoy his wealth, and stay within traditional guidelines. After much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. When he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem. Soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. He could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. This was truly the best of both worlds for the king. Unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him. The wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: People who live in grass houses should not stow thrones. ",0

"I recall my first time with a condom, I was 16 or so. I went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. There was this beautiful woman assistant behind the counter, and she could see that I was new at it. She handed me the package and asked if I knew how to wear one. I honestly answered, ‚ÄòNo, this is my first time.‚Äô So she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. She cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. I apparently still looked confused. So, she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. It was empty. ‚ÄòJust a minute,‚Äô she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. Taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. She unhooked her bra and laid it aside. ‚ÄòDo these excite you?‚Äô She asked. Well, I was so dumb-struck that all I could do was nod my head. She then said it was time to slip the condom on. As I was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her panties and lay down on a desk. ‚ÄòWell, come on‚Äô, she said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äô So I climbed on her. It was so wonderful, that unfortunately, I could no longer hold back and KAPOWWWWWWWW, I was done within a few moments. She looked at me with a bit of a frown. ‚ÄòDid you put that condom on?‚Äô she asked. I said, ‚ÄòI sure did,‚Äô and held up my thumb to show her.",0

"Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, Happy Birthday! , and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone Happy Birthday. I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember. My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday! It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me. I said, Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go! We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously. On the way back to the office, Jane said, You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we? I responded, I guess not. What do you have in mind? She said, Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner. After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back. Okay, I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing Happy birthday . And I just sat there... On the couch... Sobbing... Naked... and erect.",0

He talked about the Great Spirit But then there were 3 equally good arguments that Jesus was Irish: 1. He never got married. 2. He was always telling stories. 3. He loved green pastures.

He kept trying to get a message across to a bunch of men who just didn't get it. 3. And even when He was dead, He had to get up because there was still work to do. ",0

Rather than sit around that whole time looking stupid, some bassists decided to sneak offstage and go to the tavern next door for a quick one. After slamming several beers in quick succession, one of them looked at his watch and said, Hey! We need to get back! No need to panic, said a fellow bassist. I thought we might need some extra time, so I tied the last few pages of the conductor's score together with string. It'll take him a few minutes to get it untangled. A few moments later they staggered back to the concert hall and took their places in the orchestra.

"While in China, an American man is sexually promiscuous and does not use a condom the entire time he is there. A week after arriving back home in the States, he wakes one morning to find his penis covered with bright green and purple spots. Horrified, he immediately goes to see a doctor. The doctor, never having seen anything like this before, orders some tests and tells the man to return in two days for the results. After two days, the doctor tells him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got bad news for you, you have contracted Mongolian VD. It‚Äôs very rare and almost unheard of here in the US. We know very little about it. The man perplexed asks, Well, can‚Äôt you give me a shot or something to fix me up, Doc? The doctor answers, I‚Äôm sorry, there's no known cure. We are going to have to amputate your penis. The man screams in horror, Absolutely not !! I want a second opinion... !!! The doctor replies, Well, it‚Äôs your choice. Go ahead, if you want, but surgery is your only option.‚Äù The next day, the man seeks out a Chinese doctor, figuring that he‚Äôll know more about the disease. The Chinese doctor examines his penis and proclaims, Ahh... yes, Mongolian VD. Very rare disease. The guy says to the doctor, Yeah, yeah, I already know that, but what can we do? My American doctor wants to cut off my penis! The Chinese doctor shakes his head and laughs, Stupid Amelican docttah, always want operate, make more money that way. No need amputate! Oh, thank God!‚Äù the man exclaims. Yes,‚Äù says the Chinese doctor. Wait two weeks. Fall off by itself. ",0

On the second day, God created the monkey and said: 'Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.' The monkey said: 'Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the Dog did?' And God agreed. On the third day, God created the cow and said: 'You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years...' The cow said: 'That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?' And God agreed again. On the fourth day, God created man and said: 'Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.' But the man said: 'Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?' 'Okay,' said God, 'You asked for it.' So that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.. For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.",0

Having enormous wealth and the home they've always wanted, they aren't sure what else they could wish for. Bumbo the genie tells them, You don't need to make your final wish now. Simply call me name when you're ready, and I shall appear to grant you one last desire. A week passes and they're having a movie night, when John takes a bathroom break. As he's returning, their door is kicked down by a mob of men in white hoods who drag them from their home. They take them to a tree and begin stringing them up when Darryl screams Bumbo, Bumbo! Why won't he appear?! He could save us! John hangs his head in shame and says I... just used our last wish. Darryl screams, What?! What did you wish for? He replies, I wished we were both hung like black dudes. ",0
" I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped, and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph THAT well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries. Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He was walking around with one of those big cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend. Apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track them down, but never could. In conclusion, If it hadn't been for cotton-eye joe, I'd been married a long time ago, Where did you come from, where did you go?

"In the spirit of the upcoming Holiday I would like to share a story my Father told me when I was a boy. He sat me on his knee and said: Long ago on a snowy Christmas Eve Santa was out delivering toys to all the good kiddies. Like the many before this one it was all work, curdled milk and lame cookies. But hey, a job is a job is a job... despite his lower back pain and trick knee he loaded up his sack and slid down another filthy chimney. He noticed the same old stale snacks with warm nog and accepted the mediocrity of his career and went about unloading the gifts from sack to under the tree. Gift after gift he placed when to his surprise he heard a soft voice whisper over his shoulder: ‚ÄúSanta... I have been very good this year...‚Äù Startled, he stood up defiant of his back pain and turned to see the lady of the house posed seductively on the couch in a silky negligee... he became aware of just how warm it was and as the sweat started to bead on his brow he stammered: ‚ÄúHo Ho Ho... Gotta go Gotta go... gotta deliver all the toys to the children you know...‚Äù Turning away and resuming his task he started to really sweat... when again her voice whispered: ‚ÄúSanta.... I have been very, very, good this year...‚Äù He straightened up determined to chastise this hussy. Faced her ready to scold when he noticed she had undone the front of her sheer, yet tasteful nighty... exposing the curve of her neck to her shoulder right on down further and further ... regrouping his composure he wiped the sweat pouring down his face and said shakily: ‚ÄúHo Ho Ho.... Gotta go Gotta go... gotta deliver all the toys to the children you know...‚Äù Off balance he clumsily spun back around and fumbled around the tree not knowing what the fuck he was doing or where he was doing it when once more she whispered out: ‚ÄúSanta... I have been very, very, very good this year...‚Äù He slowly turned around and the gift in his hand slid out thudding on the floor as his gaze fell upon her standing close to him wearing her birthday suit. Thru the thudding of the blood in his ears he felt his focus rush back to him.. his vision cleared and the years fell away with the ache in his back and with a low rumble of his voice he growled: ‚ÄúHey Hey Hey... Gotta stay Gotta stay... can‚Äôt get up the chimney with my dick this way...‚Äù Just kidding.... I never knew my Father... but it is better for this Xmas story. Thanks for reading.",0

"An elderly woman walked into the Bank of Canada one morning with a purse full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the president of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money. After many lengthy discussions (after all, the client is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the president's office. The president of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, '$165,000'. The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets. The president was surprised and asked, 'What kind of bets?' The elderly woman replied, 'Well, I bet you $25,000 that your testicles are square.' The president started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that. The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the president and said, 'Would you like to take my bet?' 'Certainly', replied the president. 'I bet you $25,000 that my testicles are not square.' 'Done', the elderly woman answered. 'But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 ' clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness.' 'No problem', said the president of the Bank confidently. That night, the president became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and a gain until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet. The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the president's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the $25,000 bet made the day before that the president's testicles were square. The president confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his pants etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly. The president was happy to oblige. The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the president if she could touch them. 'Of course', said the president. 'Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.' The elderly woman did so with a little smile. Suddenly the president noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, 'Oh, it's probably because I bet him $100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the President of the Bank of Canada !'

"A young Irish man called Paddy wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. They hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived in Donegal and he lived in Kerry . Paddy consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. Off he went with his sister to Marks and Spencer‚Äôs and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. His sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. Marks and Spencer‚Äôs had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and Paddy unknowingly got the knickers. Good old Paddy sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter. Dear Maggie I chose these because I've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. If it had not been for my sister I would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). These are a very delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and I hardly noticed any marks. I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. She also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. In fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them. I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before I have a chance to see you again. When you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing. Just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year. I hope you will wear them for me on our next date. All my love, Patrick P.S. My mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.",0

"Three men were standing in line to get into heaven one day. Apparently it had been a pretty busy day, though, so Peter had to tell the first one, Heaven's getting pretty close to full today, and I've been asked to admit only people who have had particularly horrible deaths. So what's your story? So the first man replies: Well, for a while I've suspected my wife has been cheating on me, so today I came home early to try to catch her red-handed. As I came into my 25th floor apartment, I could tell something was wrong, but all my searching around didn't reveal where this other guy could have been hiding. Finally, I went out to the balcony, and sure enough, there was this man hanging off the railing, 25 floors above ground! By now I was really mad, so I started beating on him and kicking him, but wouldn't you know it, he wouldn't fall off. So finally I went back into my apartment and got a hammer and starting hammering on his fingers. Of course, he couldn't stand that for long, so he let go and fell-but even after 25 stories, he fell into the bushes, stunned but okay. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I ran into the kitchen, grabbed the fridge and threw it over the edge where it landed on him, killing him instantly. But all the stress and anger got to me, and I had a heart attack and died there on the balcony. That sounds like a pretty bad day to me, said Peter, and let the man in. The second man comes up and Peter explains to him about heaven being full, and again asks for his story. It's been a very strange day. You see, I live on the 26th floor of my apartment building, and every morning I do my exercises out on my balcony. Well, this morning I must have slipped or something, because I fell over the edge. But I got lucky, and caught the railing of the balcony on the floor below me. I knew I couldn't hang on for very long, when suddenly this man burst out onto the balcony. I thought for sure I was saved, when he started beating on me and kicking me. I held on the best I could until he ran into the apartment and grabbed a hammer and started pounding on my hands. Finally I just let go, but again I got lucky and fell into the bushes below, stunned but all right. Just when I was thinking I was going to be okay, this refrigerator comes falling out of the sky and crushes me instantly, and now I'm here. Once again, Peter had to concede that that sounded like a pretty horrible death. The third man came to the front of the line, and again the whole process was repeated. Peter explained that heaven was full and asked for his story. Picture this, says the third man, I'm hiding naked inside a refrigerator... ",0

However, sadly, his clients were unable to provide him with a car, and he had to settle for front seat tickets at an Eminem concert. So, he organized another party for an even RICHER client. Yet still, same disappointing result: no car, but an all-expenses-paid vacation to Tokyo. This went on for some time.

He made sure to emphasize the fact that he was demanding a vintage car, yet he would never get it. Finally, the day before his mother‚Äôs birthday, he was furiously speaking with clients all over, and organized a plethora of parties to see if he could somehow, someway get a vintage car for his mother in time. As you would expect, despite all his dedication, he didn‚Äôt get said vintage car. ;( So, with no idea what else to get his mother, he brought out a pen, and wrote a heartbreaking letter to her to apologize.

'Well, we were on the fifth tee...and this hole is a monster, Mother -540 yard Par 5, with a nasty dogleg left and a hidden green...and I hit the drive of my life. I creamed it.

But surely that didn't make you blaspheme, Sister!' 'No, that wasn't it,' admitted Sister. 'While I was still trying to fathom what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and runs off down the fairway!'

"Because it had no skin, muscles or other vital body parts to allow it to move. You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh. As bones are made out of a much more durable substance (mostly calcium phosphate and collagen), it does not decompose as easily, so it survives a lot longer. Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton. To be honest, even asking why a skeleton cannot attend a dance is rather preposterous. ",1

He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. May I have some of your drink? Said a bypasser to the second chemist. Sure , the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. Ha ha ha , both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact I√±aki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace. Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there.¬† One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious. So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door. Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is? I'm sorry, replied the head monk, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk. Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise. The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle. As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious. So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door. Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is? I'm sorry, replied the head monk, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk. Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise. The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle. As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious. So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door. Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is? I'm sorry, replied the head monk, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk. Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise. The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar. As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious. So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door. Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is? I'm sorry, replied the head monk, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk. Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise. That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day. The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery. He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door. Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery! I'm sorry, replied the head monk, I can't tell you. You aren't a monk. Well, then can I become a monk? Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk. So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk. Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk. ¬† So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery. Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery? asked the new monk. The head monk replied, The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek. Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise. Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end.¬† Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt! Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk. Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it. Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada. The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all. Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor.¬† The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start. Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand! Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS! He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk. Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it. Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia. The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all. Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start. Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!¬† Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself. Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.¬† Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question! Unfortunately, Reddit reader of r/AntiJokes, I cannot tell you, because you are not a monk.",1

"There once was a knight dressed in black and white garb, riding a black and white horse. He decided to get married to a princess and therefore approached the king to ask him for his daughter's hand. Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: I am the first guardian! Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse! The guardian asked: What do you want? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I want to marry the king's daughter! The guardian said: You may proceed! So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on. Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: I am the second guardian! Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse! The guardian asked: What do you want? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I want to marry the king's daughter! The guardian said: You may proceed! So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on. Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: I am the third guardian! Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse! The guardian asked: What do you want? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I want to marry the king's daughter! The guardian said: You may proceed! So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on. Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse! The king asked: What do you want? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I want to marry your daughter! The king asked: Do you have a castle of your own? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: No. The king said: You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own! So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle. Again, before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: I am the first guardian! Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse! The guardian asked: What do you want? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I want to marry the king's daughter! The guardian said: You may proceed! So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on. Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: I am the second guardian! Who are you? The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!

"Tommy was actually fully able to swim 5 minutes ago. He had his swim shorts on, and was all ready to go. But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy. Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy? , asked the devil. I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear! , Tommy exclaimed. Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take! The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother. Jeffrey!, Tom yelled, Come over here look at this view! Okay, replied Jeff. Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly. Are you okay Tommy? asked Jeff. It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that. TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!! Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff. It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan. Tommy, stop, Im not budging, said Jeff. Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things, said Tommy. But, Tommy wasn't done. While fighting with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face. Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free... said the devil. Almost? What do you mean? , asked Tommy. You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you? asked the devil. Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything! Tommy exclaimed. Deal. , said the devil, who then snapped his fingers. Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms. #x200B;",1

"List of chemicals and materials: Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section NaOH - also called lye Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says high ethyl ether content , such as Prestone Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth. Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right. List of equipment : A glass eyedropper Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one). A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) A glass quart jar Sharp scissors Clean rubber gloves Coffee filters A measuring cup Measuring spoons Preparing your Lab: Preparing Ethyl Ether: WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much. Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand. Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. Ephedrine  or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so. 6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle. 9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl. If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts popping , that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway. First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl) Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus. Items needed: Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad) Coffee filters (or filter paper) Something that measures ml and grams A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used) iodine Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this) Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this) Lye *Optional (toluene and HCI gas) Making Red Phosphorus: The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares? Making Hydroiodic Acid: This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. Now, Making Methamphetamine: To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",1

"He realized that he won't much time left on this planet anymore, that he would have to rely on his children to continue his legacy. However there was a problem. You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea. He called out to his three sons. He told them Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals. So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see. And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job. The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task. The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. The first son reported to his father. Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land. The second claimed Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land. The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers! ",1

Complimentary with every stay,1
"It read Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)? Support your answer with a proof. Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle‚Äôs Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following: First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let‚Äôs look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle‚Äôs Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added. This gives two possibilities. 1) If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose. 2) Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over. So which is it ? If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you, and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic He also got an F.",1

"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe. It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories. That night, he was approached by a promoter known as The Road , who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top. Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere. But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse. The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted. The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different. Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire. Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried. The Chicken clucked. Pecky means nothing to me. The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway. The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't. He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive. Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang. It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice. Did he buy it? Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off. The Chicken couldn't believe it. Pecky was in on the fix. The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good. The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it. The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky. The Chicken clucked. Pecky means nothing to me. But this time he meant it. The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing. So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",1

"Henry had been having trouble for quite a while lately. He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it. All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this. His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him. Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it. They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge. They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world. His dad told him You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own. Said his mother. The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him. His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",1

"While they are at high altitude, the stewardess comes down the aisle and asks everyone what they would like for their in-flight meal. She turns to the Rabbi and says, Sir, are you from New York? Because we serve fresh NYC bagels with locks and cream cheese on this flight. The Rabbi is delighted to hear this and orders that. Then the stewardess turns to the Mexican woman and says, And ma'am we also have some very tasty pozole that we serve, would that interest you? The Mexican woman is shocked that they would serve such a dish but she's delighted and says, I would love some! Finally the stewardess turns to the U.S. soldier, and before she can say anything he blurts out, Ma'am I think I'll have the bagel too! I'm also from New York. ",1
"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. When he gets to class he asks the teacher ‚Äúma‚Äôam, what‚Äôs the red ribbon story?‚Äù Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal‚Äôs office. When he gets to the principal‚Äôs office, he asks the principal, ‚ÄúI overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What‚Äôs the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I‚Äôm expelling you.‚Äù So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he‚Äôs clearly distraught. He says to his mother, ‚ÄúMom, I got expelled from school today.‚Äù His mom was surprised. ‚ÄúWhy on earth did that happen?‚Äù Johnny said, ‚ÄúWell, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal‚Äôs office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what‚Äôs the red ribbon story?‚Äù His mom shakes her head sadly. ‚ÄúGo to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.‚Äù When Johnny‚Äôs dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, ‚ÄúWell, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal‚Äôs office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what‚Äôs the red ribbon story?‚Äù Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, ‚ÄúJohnny, get out of this house and don‚Äôt you ever come back.‚Äù Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he‚Äôd been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. That‚Äôs when he got hit by a car. The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street. ",1

"It jump starts my day and gives me that extra boost in productivity and focus. Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific ‚Äî and fairly common ‚Äî genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories ‚Äî up to hundreds of calories in some cases. Please drink responsibly. ",1

"None of these can be represented adequately as a moving *point;* each involves a body that *rotates* about an axis that is stationary in some inertial frame of reference. Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion. Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them‚Äîstretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We‚Äôll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body. We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we‚Äôll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",1

" So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free. He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him. Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it. About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee. The man then starts talking to the monk, It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it? he asked the monk replied Economic reasons. The man then says I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences? Because the monk replied, I am really desperate for money. ",1

"Well they fly through water if that means anything... Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them. Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird‚Äôs wings. In fact, penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper. By the same token, penguins aren‚Äôt nearly as concerned about being light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers. There‚Äôs no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies. Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus compromise. By giving up on flight they‚Äôve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",1
