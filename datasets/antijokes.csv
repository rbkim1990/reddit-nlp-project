zuluportero,101,/r/AntiJokes/comments/91gkoc/difference_between_an_anti_joke_and_just_two/,2582,"Anti joke: Why did Jimmy drop his ice cream? Because he got hit by a bus

Not an anti joke: Why did Jimmy drop his ice cream? Because he wasn't careful and bumped into someone else.

see an anti joke still has to be unexpected. The answer has to be stupid. Something that does make sense and is obvious but isn't the answer you would normally expect.

Every laugh is caused by surprise. If you say anti-jokes aren't supposed to make you laugh, then you're wrong. They are supposed to be so bad they are funny, not just bad but not extremely bad so you don't even care. If a logical question and answer was an anti joke I'd be laughing all day.",AntiJokes,Difference between an Anti Joke and just two sentences.

You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh. As bones are made out of a much more durable substance (mostly calcium phosphate and collagen), it does not decompose as easily, so it survives a lot longer. Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton. To be honest, even asking why a skeleton cannot attend a dance is rather preposterous. ",AntiJokes,Why didn't the skeleton go to the dance?

The bartender serves the first chemist water and the second chemist hydrogen peroxide, and warns him not to consume it, because it is deadly. The first chemist drinks his water. The second chemist, who had already accepted his death, knew drinking the content of his glass would be lethal. Hell, even the bartender knew and warned him. He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. ""May I have some of your drink?"" Said a bypasser to the second chemist. ""Sure"", the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. ""Ha ha ha"", both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact Iñaki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace.

Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years. He did, however, file an appeal which is now being reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The king asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry your daughter!"" The king asked: ""Do you have a castle of your own?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

He had noticed his wife had begun to act strangely. She wouldn’t return his calls at work, she was vague about what happened whole he was away, and often too tired to do anything after he got home. 

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!!"" Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff.

It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

DocDerz,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a0b2et/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,18,"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Preebie,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a01h6v/the_red_ribbon_story/,2,"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. 

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Economic reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?

Blockinite,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a5jfyd/why_didnt_the_skeleton_go_to_the_dance/,4,"Because it had no skin, muscles or other vital body parts to allow it to move. You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh. As bones are made out of a much more durable substance (mostly calcium phosphate and collagen), it does not decompose as easily, so it survives a lot longer. Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton. To be honest, even asking why a skeleton cannot attend a dance is rather preposterous. ",AntiJokes,Why didn't the skeleton go to the dance?

The bartender serves the first chemist water and the second chemist hydrogen peroxide, and warns him not to consume it, because it is deadly. The first chemist drinks his water. The second chemist, who had already accepted his death, knew drinking the content of his glass would be lethal. Hell, even the bartender knew and warned him. He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. ""May I have some of your drink?"" Said a bypasser to the second chemist. ""Sure"", the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. ""Ha ha ha"", both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact Iñaki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace.

Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years. He did, however, file an appeal which is now being reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!""

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

5 months later they had found out that their child had been miscarried.

John and Karen’s life spiraled out of control for a while, but they went to counseling and worked through it, but never tried for a child again.

After a while John was unhappy and unsatisfied with his life. His wife was hard to communicate with, he had lost all interest in his job, and he had loans to pay.

He had noticed his wife had begun to act strangely. She wouldn’t return his calls at work, she was vague about what happened whole he was away, and often too tired to do anything after he got home. 

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

“I knew it!” John howled. “You are cheating on me!”

In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

Pete is taken to the hospital just in time. If it had been just an hour later, Pete would have been too far gone to receive the care he needed.

Two weeks later, Pete was released from the hospital and decided to pay a visit to the brothel to tell them what had become of Cussin' Polly and how their services had ended up giving him a second chance at life.

DocDerz,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a0b2et/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,17,"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Economic reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""I am really desperate for money.""",AntiJokes,A man's fence is broken and he needs to hire someone to fix it.

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?

You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh.

Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton.

The second chemist, who had already accepted his death, knew drinking the content of his glass would be lethal. Hell, even the bartender knew and warned him. He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. ""May I have some of your drink?"" Said a bypasser to the second chemist. ""Sure"", the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. ""Ha ha ha"", both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact Iñaki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace.

Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years.

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The king asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry your daughter!"" The king asked: ""Do you have a castle of your own?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

Again, before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was led to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!""

The king asked: ""Do you have a castle of your own?""

After a while John was unhappy and unsatisfied with his life. His wife was hard to communicate with, he had lost all interest in his job, and he had loans to pay.

He had noticed his wife had begun to act strangely. She wouldn’t return his calls at work, she was vague about what happened whole he was away, and often too tired to do anything after he got home. 

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!!"" Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff.

It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH - also called lye

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

DocDerz,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a0b2et/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,17,"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Preebie,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a01h6v/the_red_ribbon_story/,2,"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. 

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Economic reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""I am really desperate for money.""",AntiJokes,A man's fence is broken and he needs to hire someone to fix it.

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?

You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh. As bones are made out of a much more durable substance (mostly calcium phosphate and collagen), it does not decompose as easily, so it survives a lot longer. Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton. To be honest, even asking why a skeleton cannot attend a dance is rather preposterous. ",AntiJokes,Why didn't the skeleton go to the dance?

The second chemist, who had already accepted his death, knew drinking the content of his glass would be lethal. Hell, even the bartender knew and warned him. He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. ""May I have some of your drink?"" Said a bypasser to the second chemist. ""Sure"", the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. ""Ha ha ha"", both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact Iñaki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace.

Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years.

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

She smiles and doesn't reply. ""Come on, tell me! What is your life like?"" She replies to him while getting in the car, ""Maybe I am, now make sure the paparazzi doesn't see you."" He looks around and notices Jacky laughing, she tells him ""I'm a CEO, rich but not famous famous. I hope to see you again Mr. Jackson"" and drives off. He laughs and walks inside.

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?""

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!""

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!!"" Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff.

It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH - also called lye

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

DocDerz,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a0b2et/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,16,"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Preebie,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a01h6v/the_red_ribbon_story/,2,"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. 

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Little Johnny was doing the activity and was given a photograph of the devastating wildfires in Paradise, California. He wrote a caption: “Paraddise is burning!” Stacy, the head of HR who was supervising the activity, corrected his spelling: “There’s only one ‘D’ in ‘Paradise,’” she said.

“Oh,” Little Johnny said. “Just like how there’s one ‘D’ in my mommy, Nadia?” Stacy was secretly amused by the double entendre and said, “Well, yes.”

After the activity, Johnny’s mom, a mid-level managing editor, picked him up at the HR office took him to the cafeteria for lunch. She asked him how his day was, and he said it was fine.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Economic reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?""

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!""

The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

5 months later they had found out that their child had been miscarried.

John and Karen’s life spiraled out of control for a while, but they went to counseling and worked through it, but never tried for a child again.

After a while John was unhappy and unsatisfied with his life. His wife was hard to communicate with, he had lost all interest in his job, and he had loans to pay.

He had noticed his wife had begun to act strangely. She wouldn’t return his calls at work, she was vague about what happened whole he was away, and often too tired to do anything after he got home. 

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

“I knew it!” John howled. “You are cheating on me!”

But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!!"" Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff.

It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

&amp;#x200B;",AntiJokes,Why can't Tommy swim?

Diluted HCl - also called Muriatic acid - can be obtained from hardware stores, in the pool section

NaOH - also called lye

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Preebie,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a01h6v/the_red_ribbon_story/,2,"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. 

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Economic reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""I am really desperate for money.""",AntiJokes,A man's fence is broken and he needs to hire someone to fix it.

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?

Not an anti joke: Why did Jimmy drop his ice cream? Because he wasn't careful and bumped into someone else.

see an anti joke still has to be unexpected. The answer has to be stupid. Something that does make sense and is obvious but isn't the answer you would normally expect.

Every laugh is caused by surprise. If you say anti-jokes aren't supposed to make you laugh, then you're wrong.

You see, skeletons are the product of a corpse - normally human - degrading through lack of preservation and microorganisms consuming the flesh. As bones are made out of a much more durable substance (mostly calcium phosphate and collagen), it does not decompose as easily, so it survives a lot longer. Skeletons, therefore, remain when all other organic matter does not. We move around through our muscles and tendons working in tandom to achieve leverage, carefully coordinated to achieve movement. Skeletons do not have this ability, and therefore would be completely incapable of dancing or even attending the dance in the first place. This is without even considering the simple fact that the skeleton is no longer sentient: the brain would have wasted away long before the entity would be considered a skeleton. To be honest, even asking why a skeleton cannot attend a dance is rather preposterous. ",AntiJokes,Why didn't the skeleton go to the dance?

The second chemist, who had already accepted his death, knew drinking the content of his glass would be lethal. Hell, even the bartender knew and warned him. He slowly began to realise people care about him and regretted his decision to put an end to his life. ""May I have some of your drink?"" Said a bypasser to the second chemist. ""Sure"", the sadistic chemist said to the bypasser, who just awkwardly asked a person he doesn't know for some of his drink. It didn't take long before the bypasser dropped dead onto the floor of the bar. ""Ha ha ha"", both chemists rejoiced and laughed at the bypasser, who now was but a corpse, and at his tomfoolery. What they did not know was that this bypasser was in fact Iñaki Urdangarin, a member of the Spanish royal family. He died at the young age of 50, from hydrogen peroxide poisoning. His death was mourned by tens of thousands of Spaniards, and a funeral took place in Madrid on December 9th, 2018. May he rest in peace.

Update: Both chemists were arrested. The second chemist was found guilty of second-hand murder and was jailed for 30 years. The first chemist was found complicit, and was sentenced for 10 years.

Va_Joe_Joe,2,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a4qlp3/there_was_a_little_boy_who_lived_in_a_far_away/,1,"Close to the boy's home, there was a tall mountain, always covered in snow at the top. Also at the top of the mountain, there was an ancient monastery where ancient monks lived.

Sometimes, the little boy, as he was riding his tricycle around his yard, would look up at the monastery on the tall mountain and wonder what it was like up there. 

One day, when the wind was blowing down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold and the little boy could hear a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the little boy made a peanut butter sandwich, hopped on his tricycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours and hours, but he finally made it to the top. He bravely pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hello, Mr. Monk, sir. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the little boy got back on his tricycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was a bit bigger and stronger now and now rode around town on his bicycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the bigger boy made a ham and cheese sandwich, hopped on his bicycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him hours, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Hey, Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the big boy got back on his bicycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy had grown into a strapping youth now and rode around town on his motorcycle.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the strapping youth grabbed a slice of pizza, hopped on his motorcycle and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 30 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Yo, Mr. Monk, dude. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the strapping youth got back on his motorcycle and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

The wind did not blow down off the mountain again until a couple years later. The boy was now a young man and often rode around in his new convertible sportscar.

As luck would have it, he was out riding when the wind blew down off the mountain, the air turned quite cold, and he heard a very strange noise on the wind. It was coming from the monastery! He could not figure out what could possibly be making such a strange noise and he was curious.

So, the young man bought a burger at a fast food place, got in his convertible sportscar, and started his ride up to the monastery. It took him 20 minutes, but he finally made it to the top. He pounded on the massive door to the monastery and the head monk opened the door.

""Mr. Monk. Down at my home in the valley below, I heard a very strange noise coming from your monastery. Could you tell me what it is?""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

Sadly, the young man got back in his convertible sportscar and rode all the way home, in a very foul and frustrated mood. He really did want to know what was making that noise.

That night, he thought and thought about the very strange noise and how he just had to know what caused it. So, he resolved to do something about it the next day.

The next day, he got in his convertible sportscar and raced up the mountain, slammed on his brakes, and skidded to a stop right in front of the massive door to the monastery.

He honked the horn of his convertible sportscar until the head monk finally opened the door.

""Alright, Mr. Monk, I want to know what is making that very strange noise coming from you monastery!""

""I'm sorry,"" replied the head monk, ""I can't tell you. You aren't a monk.""

""Well, then can I become a monk?""

""Why certainly! It is quite easy. You must travel the earth and count the number of blades of grass in every field and the number of grains of sand on every beach. When you return with your answer, then you shall be a monk.""

So the young man left the monastery and travelled the earth. For years and years he counted the blades of grass and grains of sand, until one day he had finally finished. He made his way slowly back to the monastery and found the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk, I have travelled the earth these past years, counting the blades of grass and grains of sand. I finally know that there are 123,123,123,123,123 blades of grass in the fields and 123,123,123,123,123 grains of sand on the beaches and I would like to become a monk."" 

So the man became a monk. At last, he would now be able to find out the source of that very strange noise coming from the monastery.

""Mr. Monk, what is the noise coming from the monastery?"" asked the new monk.

The head monk replied, ""The source is too complicated to describe in words. I am afraid that you must see it for yourself to truly understand it. This key will show you the answer you seek.""

""Take this key to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. There you will find a long corridor. At the end of the corridor is a door and through the door is the thing that makes the noise.""

Well, of course the new monk went immediately to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and there he did indeed find the long corridor. He walked down the corridor until he could see the door at the end. 

Unfortunately, there were three magical fires that never go out blocking the man from the door. He decided to jump the fires to reach the door. The man made sure the key was secure in his hand, took a running charge at the first fire and leapt!

Over the first fire he flew, but he dropped the key. The man leapt back over the fire, ran all the way back down the long corridor, out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery and back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the first one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is another key and you must overcome tests on your way to enlightenment. The second key, however is far, far away in Canada.""

The new monk left the monastery and travelled to Canada. It took many years because he had no money, being a monk and all.

Eventually, he arrived in Canada and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. 

The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the monk, key still- RATS!
He had dropped the key in the second fire. The monk leapt back over the second fire, back over the first fire, back down the long corridor he walked and out of the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery. The monk went back to the head monk.

""Oh, Mr. Monk! I am so sorry! I went to the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery, down the long corridor to the door, but there were magical fires and I dropped the key in the second one as I leapt over it.""

""Do not worry, for there is one more key and we must all overcome tests on our way to enlightenment. The third key, however is far, far away in Australia.""

The monk left the monastery and travelled to Australia. It took many years because he had no money being a monk and all.

Eventually he arrived in Australia and managed to track down the key to the door. The monk then had to make the return journey equally as painstakingly, but finally he arrived back at the monastery. By this time, he was quite an old monk.

Down into the deepest, darkest corner of the coldest, dampest room in the dirtiest, filthiest cavern under the monastery he went, until he found the long corridor. The three magical fires were in front of him as he took a running start.

Over the first fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

Over the second fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand! 

Over the THIRD fire went the quite old monk, key still in hand!

He had made it! He'd made the jumps and here he was standing outside the door with the answer to his question. Finally, finally, after so many, many, many years of wanting to know what was making the strange noise, he would know. The answer lay through the door in front of him and he could at last be at peace with himself.

Slowly, the quite old monk slid the key into the lock. Turning the key a slight 'click' was to be heard as the lock moved back allowing the quite old monk to open the door. He pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Shock and amazement came over him as he finally realized the answer to his question!

The entrepreneur pounces forward and says “I want to be the richest man in the world!!” The receptionist makes a keycard and hands it to him. “Floor 1274, room 53. Enjoy eternity.” Giddy with excitement, the entrepreneur snatches the card and runs to the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The Muslim man steps forward, and sheepishly whispers “Can I... have an infinite supply of virgins?” The receptionist makes a key and says “floor 58785, room 88.” The Muslim man takes the card shaking nervously and goes up the elevator. 

“Next,” says the receptionist. The hippie thinks for a moment and says “honestly, all I really want is to be surrounded by people who love eachother and get along. People who harbor no ill will toward others and spread love freely. People who don’t want war or to see others suffer.” The receptionist makes a card key and says “floor 462884748384, room 1.” The hippie takes the card and goes up the elevator. 

A while later, the Muslim man returns to the lobby and finds the entrepreneur has done the same. The entrepreneur says “Man, I thought my paradise was going to be easy, but they’re making me work hard to be the richest man in the world! Everyone else is trying to do the same thing, backstabbing, lying, stealing, anything to get ahead! And worst of all, there’s no women at all! I’m jealous of your version of paradise.”
The Muslim man says “don’t be, my paradise is just a universe full of horny men who want an infinite supply of virgins. I don’t think this hotel gives you what you want, they just put you in a room with all the other people who wished for the same thing.”
“Hm, I wonder what our hippie friend wished for? He’ll probably be down in a second too.”
“Probably.”

But the hippie never returned. He never even realized that the hotel doesn’t give you paradise. He lived happily ever after in his own version of heaven. ",AntiJokes,"An entrepreneur, a Muslim, and a hippie all die in a car accident together."

Before arriving at the castle, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered a guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the first guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Soon, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the second guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Then, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, encountered yet another guardian. The guardian said: ""I am the third guardian! Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The guardian asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry the king's daughter!"" The guardian said: ""You may proceed!"" So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, rode on.

Finally, the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, reached the castle. The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, was let to the king. The king asked: ""Who are you?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I am the black and white knight, riding on my black and white horse!"" The king asked: ""What do you want?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""I want to marry your daughter!"" The king asked: ""Do you have a castle of your own?"" The black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, said: ""No."" The king said: ""You cannot marry my daughter without a castle of your own!""

So the black and white knight, riding on his black and white horse, left the castle and spent some years amassing the wealth needed for building a castle. Then, he re-approached the king's castle.

After a while John was unhappy and unsatisfied with his life. His wife was hard to communicate with, he had lost all interest in his job, and he had loans to pay.

He had noticed his wife had begun to act strangely. She wouldn’t return his calls at work, she was vague about what happened whole he was away, and often too tired to do anything after he got home. 

John suspected she was cheating, and so, one day instead of taking his normal lunch break and eating what he brought to work, he drove home. He walked in and saw a handsome and toned man sitting at their table in a nice suit, while Karen cooked something for the two.

But Tommy forgot something. 5 years ago, he made an agreement with the devil. In exchange for free gummy candy, Tommy agreed that if he didn't kill someone in 5 years, he would have to make it up to the devil. Of course, Tommy must not have been listening, because he agreed. So, the devil showed up to talk with Tommy.

""Why haven't you killed anyone yet, Tommy?"", asked the devil.

""I didn't know I had to, I'll do it right now, I swear!"", Tommy exclaimed.

""Okay, good, but if someone isn't dead in the next 10 minutes, you'll be the soul I'll have to take!""

The devil vanished, leaving Tommy an emotional mess. He looked around for someone to kill, only to see his brother. He knew it was him or his brother.

""Jeffrey!,"" Tom yelled,"" Come over here look at this view!""

""Okay,"" replied Jeff.

Jeff walked over slowly to Tommy, but noticed Tommy was trembling and looked sickly.

""Are you okay Tommy?"" asked Jeff.

It was too late, Jeff was close enough for Tommy to lounge at. So he did just that.

""TOMMY WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING, WE'RE BROTHERS!!!!"" Jeff said, trying not to get thrown off the cliff.

It was clear Jeff was not budging, and Tommy knew this was bad. Tommy lounged at Jeff, but this time he had a plan.

""Tommy, stop, Im not budging,"" said Jeff.

""Okay fine, sorry, I think I'm seeing things,"" said Tommy.

But, Tommy wasn't done. While ""fighting"" with Jeff, he took his keys for his car. Tommy walked off, and Jeff caught on pretty quickly. But once Jeff noticed, Tommy got in the car quickly. Tommy fired up the engine. Tommy never drove a car before, and this was a new experience for him. He turned the gear to drive and floored it. Jeff dove for a bush, and Tommy lost control. All the trees and rocks made driving too difficult. He was going way too fast when he lost control, and the car flipped over and kept spinning, and eventually flew off the edge. The cliff was quite high, but Tommy managed to survive. When he got out, he noticed he crashed into someone else's campsite. He looked around, and found something weird. He hit an old fisherman, just sitting by the fire, and all that was left was the fishing gear, a puddle, and a huge splat of blood that went everywhere. The devil came back, with a smile on is face.

""Well done Tommy, you have killed someone, you are almost free..."" said the devil.

""Almost? What do you mean?"", asked Tommy.

""You don't think I'd let you off the hook for being late on this, did you?"" asked the devil.

""Fine, as long as I stay alive, I'll do anything!"" Tommy exclaimed.

""Deal."", said the devil, who then snapped his fingers.

Tommy felt relieved, he didn't notice anything wrong. But, when he tried to itch his face, he realized something... He has no arms. So to answer the question, the reason Tommy can't swim is because he has no arms.

Ethyl Ether - aka Diethyl Ether - Et-0-Et - can be obtained from engine starting fluid, usually from a large supermarket. Look for one that says ""high ethyl ether content"", such as Prestone

Ephedrine The cottons in todays vicks nasle inhalers dont contain efed or pfed (ephedrin or psuedoephedrin) but there are still lots of easy ways to get good ephed or pfed, pure ephedrin can be extracted out of it's plant matter, from a plant that can be bought at most garden stores. Or you can get pfed from decongestive pills like sudafed. Most people perfer to work with pfed from pills rather then ephed from the plant. The important thing is that you must have pure pfed/ephed as any contaminants will fuck up the molar ratio leaving you with over-reduced shit or under-reduced shit. Or contaminats will jell durring baseifying and gak up your product which will then be very hard to clean. So you want to find a pill that is nearly pure pfed hcl, or as close to pure as you can get. Also check the lable on your pills and see what inactive ingredients they contain. Inactive ingredients are things like binders and flavors. These you dont want and will remove when cleaning your pills. but certain inactive ingredients are harder to remove then others. You dont want pills with a red coating, you dont want pills with alot of cellose in them and you dont want pills with much wax. you also dont want pills that contain povidone. As a rule, if you have a two pills that contain the same amount of pfed hcl then take the smaller sized pill because it obviously has less binders and inactive ingredients, time released pills are usualy harder to work with because they have more binders and tend to gel up durring the a/b stage. Also only buy pills that have pfed hcl as the only active ingredient. You first have to make ephedrine (which is sometimes sold as meth by itself):If you are selling it...I would just make ephedrine and say it's meth.

Distilled water - it's really cheap, so you have no reason to use the nasty stuff from the tap. Do things right.


List of equipment : 
A glass eyedropper 

Three small glass bottles with lids (approx. 3 oz., but not important)one should be marked at 1.5oz, use tape on the outside to mark it (you might want to label it as ether). One should be clear (and it can't be the marked one).

A Pyrex dish (the meatloaf one is suggested) 

A glass quart jar 

Sharp scissors

Clean rubber gloves

Coffee filters

A measuring cup

Measuring spoons 


Preparing your Lab:

Preparing Ethyl Ether:
WARNING: Ethyl Ether is very flammable and is heavier than air. Do not use ethyl ether near flame or non-sparkless motors. It is also an anaesthetic and can cause respiratory collapse if you inhale too much.

Take the unmarked small bottle and spray starter fluid in it until it looks half-full. Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake for 5 minutes. Let it sit for a minute or two, and tap the side to try and separate the clear upper layer. Then, draw off the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, and throw away the lower (water) and cloudy layer. Place the ether in the marked container. Repeat this until you have about 1.5 oz. of ether. Put the cap on it, and put it in the freezer if you can. Rinse the other bottle and let it stand.

Ethyl ether is very pungent. Even a small evaporated amount is quite noticeable. 

Ephedrine &amp; or P-Ephedrine: Please discuss this on the neonjoint forum 

5. Pour 1/8 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle of ephedrine and agitate. Do this carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off hydrogen gas and/or steam. H2 gas is explosive and lighter than air, avoid any flames as usual. Repeat this step until the mixture remains cloudy. This step neutralizes the HCl in the salt, leaving the insoluble free base (l-desoxyephedrine) again. Why do we do this? So that we can get rid of any water-soluble impurities. For 3 oz. bottles, this should take only 3 repetitions or so.

6. Fill the bottle from step 5 up the rest of the way with ethyl ether. Cap the bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes. It is very important to expose every molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible. This will cause the free base to dissolve into the ether (it -is- soluble in ether). 

7. Let the mixture settle. There will be a middle layer that is very thick. Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible. This is why this bottle should be clear. 

8. Remove the top (ether) layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of the middle layer in it. Place the removed ether layer into a third bottle.

9. Add to the third bottle enough water to fill it half-way and about 5 drops of muriatic acid. Cap it. Shake the bottle for 2 minutes. When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away. The free base has now been bonded to the HCl again, forming a water soluble salt. This time, we're getting rid of ether-soluble impurities. Make sure to get rid of all the ether before going to step 11! 

10. If there is anything left from step 3, repeat the procedure with it. 

11. Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat. You can do this on the stove or nuke it in the microwave (be careful of splashing), but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater (like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the remaining crystals will be ephedrine HCl.

If you microwave it, I suggest no more than 5-10s at one time. If it starts ""popping"", that means you have too little liquid left to microwave. You can put it under a bright (100W) lamp instead. Microwaving can result in uneven heating, anyway.

First Batch: 120mg ephedrine HClEstimated: 300mg (100% of theoretical, disregarding HCl)

Now, Making Methamphetamine out of ephedrine by reducing it with Hydroiodic Acid and Red Phosphorus.

Items needed:
Alot of matchbooks (the kind with the striking pad)

Coffee filters (or filter paper)

Something that measures ml and grams

A flask (a small pot with a lid can be used)

iodine

Hydroiodic Acid (I will tell you how to make this)

Red Phosphorus (I will tell you how to make this)

Lye

*Optional (toluene and HCI gas) 


Making Red Phosphorus:
The striking pad on books of matches is about 50% red phosphorus. The determined experimenter could obtain a pile of red phosphorus by scraping off the striking pads of matchbooks with a sharp knife. A typical composition of the striking pad is about 50% red phosphorus, along with about 30% antimony sulfide, and lesser amounts of glue, iron oxide, MnO2, and glass powder. I don't think these contaminants will seriously interfere with the reaction. Naturally, it is a tedious process to get large amounts of red phosphorus by scraping the striking pads off matchbooks, but who cares?

Making Hydroiodic Acid:
This is made by mixing iodine and red phosphorus. When making hydroiodic acid from iodine and red phosphorus, the acid is prepared first, and allowed to come to complete reaction for 20 minutes before adding the ephedrine to it. The way around the roadblock here is to just boil off some more of the water from the ephedrine extract, and make the acid mixture in fresh pure water. Since the production of HI from iodine and red phosphorus gives off a good deal of heat, it is wise to chill the mixture in ice, and slowly add the iodine crystals to the red phosphorus-water mixture. 

Now, Making Methamphetamine:
To do the reaction, a 1000 ml round bottom flask is filled with 150 grams of ephedrine. Also added to the flask are 40 grams of red phosphorus and 340 ml of 47% hydroiodic acid. This same acid and red phosphorus mixture can be prepared from adding 150 grams of iodine crystals to 150 grams of red phosphorus in 300 ml of water. This should produce the strong hydroiodic acid solution needed. Exactly how strong the acid needs to be, I can't say . With the ingredients mixed together in the flask, a condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is boiled for one day. This length of time is needed for best yields and highest octane numbers on the product. While it is cooking, the mixture is quite red and messy looking from the red phosphorus floating around in it.When one day of boiling under reflux is up, the flask is allowed to cool, then it is diluted with an equal volume of water. Next, the red phosphorus is filtered out. A series of doubled up coffee filters will work to get out all the red phosphorus, but real filter paper is better. The filtered solution should look a golden color. A red color may indicate that all the red phosphorus is not yet out. If so, it is filtered again. The filtered-out phosphorus can be saved for use in the next batch. If filtering does not remove the red color, there may be iodine floating around the solution. It can be removed by adding a few dashes of sodium bisulfate or sodium thiosulfate.The next step in processing the batch is to neutralize the acid. A strong lye solution is mixed up and added to the batch while shaking until the batch is strongly basic. This brings the meth out as liquid free base floating on top of the water. The strongly basic solution is shaken vigorously to ensure that all the meth has been converted to the free base. You now can sell or use the free base for injection use or with free base meth now obtained, the next step you can do is to form the crystalline hydrochloride salt of meth. To do this, a few hundred mls of toluene is added to the batch, and the meth free base extracted out as usual. If the chemist's cooking has been careful, the color of the toluene extract will be clear to pale yellow. If this is the case, the product is sufficiently pure to make nice white crystals just by bubbling dry HCl gas through the toluene extract. If the toluene extract is darker colored, a distillation is called for to get pure meth free base. The yield of pure methamphetamine hydrochloride should be from 100 to 110 grams.",AntiJokes,Unfunny meth joke

You see the farmer had 2 big plots of land, with a road stretched out in the middle. It would be impossible to divide it into three equal parts, for fear that rivalry would arise. Not forgetting to mention the farmer kept a barn full of animals. With a stench so horrible, no one would volunteer to take on the job. 

So the old farmer thought to himself. He thought long and hard. Until he had an idea.

He called out to his three sons. He told them ""Children, my time is limited. When I pass, you would need to continue my life's work. However only 2 of you would get the big plots of land. The latter would have to tend to the animals.""

""So I will give each of you a task. Whoever complete it to satisfactory, would inherit my land. Three neighbouring farms require mowing, for the weeds grows and the wind blows, there shall be no crops. Tend to the land, and we shall see."" 

And so the three fellow set off, each with a task at hand. The first son borrowed a hoe. He raked and raked till his back ached and his feet hurt. But alas, he completed his job.

The second was brighter. He borrowed two bulls, hooked a cart and drove them about the farm land. As the bulls go, the cart raked for him. Very soon, he too completed the task.

The third son, he did not tend to the farm at all. Infact, he drove of into the city, doing who knows what and god knows what. Finally, he returned to his father, no sweat, no tears. 

The first son reported to his father. ""Beloved father. I showed great perseverance, and compassion for the land. For I manually raked the place till clean and fertile. I deserve your plot of land.""

The second claimed ""Dad I proved myself by using my intellect, solving problems with the best directives. I deserve your plot of land.""

The father smiled, for his first two sons did prove of worth. He turned to his third son who said ""lmao yall gon be farmers? I aint touching that. Id be CEO and shit. Later losers!""",AntiJokes,An old farmer had three sons

Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle’s Law (gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed) or some variant, so he gave them an F. One student, however, wrote the following:

    First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time.  So, we need to know the rate that souls are moving into Hell and the rate they are leaving.  I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave.  Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let’s look at the different religions that exist in the world today.  Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially.  Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle’s Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand as souls are added.  This gives two possibilities.




    1)  If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.




    2)  Of course, if Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.

    So which is it ?  If we accept the postulate given to me by Ms. Therese Banyan during my Freshman year that ""It will be a cold night in Hell before I sleep with you,""  and take into account the fact that I still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her, then (2) cannot be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic

DocDerz,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a0b2et/why_did_the_chicken_cross_the_road/,18,"As with most things in life, the answer to that question is complicated. It all started in the small Nevada town of Lovelock, at the Whiskey Creek Saloon. The Chicken, young, cocky, and full of bravado, was drinking it up after a good day at the fights. He'd just won his sixteenth straight bout, and so far had only been defeated once. That had been his second fight, and he'd been beaten soundly by a veteran cock-fighter named Gentleman Joe in front of his then-fiance Pecky. He lost the fight, and then Pecky, both to the swaggering cock-of-the-walk Joe.

It was something he vowed would never happen again, and so far, he'd made good on this promise to himself. Sixteen fights, sixteen decisive victories.

That night, he was approached by a promoter known as ""The Road"", who told him that he could help put The Chicken on the straight and narrow, all the way to the top.

Now, The Chicken was doing pretty well for himself and didn't really need The Road, and so politely declined his offer. The Road, not one to take no for an answer, came back after each fight. He asked, and The Chicken turned him down. Each time they danced, but The Road was getting nowhere.

But that all changed on the hot, sultry morning of August 12, 1976. On that morning, Gentleman Joe found himself in The Road's office, brokering a comeback deal. Gentleman Joe had retired, but he had debts. Debts that threatened his coop, coup, and son, Coop. But he also still had a mean right hook, and he figured he could put it to use for one final purse.

The Road finally had something The Chicken wanted.

The next night, after basting a Turkey in the ring, The Chicken was enjoying his usual Prairie Oyster. The Road's appearance prompted an eye-roll from The Chicken, but The Road's slight smile in response gave The Chicken pause. Something was different.

Three shots and a handshake later, The Chicken and The Road were in business. The Chicken and Gentleman Joe were set for a rematch. The Chicken took the bout seriously, vowing not to underestimate the older, veteran cock, and took to his training lit by a new fire.

Three days before the fight, The Road paid a visit to The Chicken. The fix was in, and The Chicken was going to take a dive in the fifth. Before The Chicken could even begin clucking, The Road let him know that if he didn't, Pecky was going to be plucked and deep-fried.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me.""

The night before the fight, Pecky showed up on his stoop, small, cold, afraid. She told The Chicken that she'd made the wrong choice and that her time with Gentleman Joe had been a nightmare. She feared for her life, and her son's. She knew she had no right to ask, but she was anyway.

The Chicken wanted to say no, but despite her shacking up with Gentleman Joe, despite her keeping the cock's ring after calling off the wedding, and despite naming her son Cooper, something her and The Chicken had decided on when planning their life together, he still loved her. He wanted to say no, wanted to hold to his vow that he'd never lose again, but he couldn't.

He called The Road and told him he'd take the dive.

Pecky left, and The Chicken settled in for a long night of drinking, cracking open a fresh bottle of sour grain mash whiskey. And he would have finished that bottle and passed out in a stupor, but he was barely two shots in when his phone rang.

It was Pecky. He answered, but there was no reply. She had chicken-butt dialed him. He was about to hang up when he heard The Road's familiar voice.

""Did he buy it?"" ""Like it was a brand new feather duster for 90% off."" The Chicken couldn't believe it.

Pecky was in on the fix.

The next night, Gentleman Joe fought well. For four rounds, he had The Chicken bobbing and weaving, dropping hurt bombs and connecting on more than a few. Gentleman Joe was feeling good. The Road was feeling good. Pecky was feeling good.

The bell sounded. Round five. Gentleman Joe casually strolled out into the ring, prancing and strutting, and wasn't even looking when The Chicken's first shot connected. It was a doozy, but it was merely the opener, and The Chicken followed up with a brutal barrage, stacking hurt so heavy on Gentleman Joe that Atlas would have had a hard time bearing it.

The round came to a close, and Gentleman Joe's comatose body was dragged from the ring. The Road, furious, vowed to make The Chicken pay, starting with Pecky.

The Chicken clucked. ""Pecky means nothing to me."" But this time he meant it.

The Road made good on his promise and plucked Pecky. The Chicken felt nothing.

So why'd The Chicken cross The Road? For love. And revenge.",AntiJokes,Why did the chicken cross the road?

NotANaziOrCommie,13,/r/AntiJokes/comments/9zv33d/what_stopped_the_depressed_boy_from_committing/,195,"Henry had been having trouble for quite a while lately. He was only 17, but his parents were putting lots of pressure on him to take advanced classes in school to get into a prestegious university. He was taking all AP curriculum classes, and there was just too much stress for him to handle. He was incredibly bright and popular among the teachers, and had many friends, although he may not have realized it.

All teachers think that children don't get that much homework. They all think ""I'll just assign them half an hour each day. Half an hour isnt that much"" but what teachers don't account for is that other teachers give homework too, which adds up to too much unneccessary pressure on students. Especially for Henry, since he was taking all AP classes. With this and his part time job that he worked to save up for uni in case he didn't get a scholarship. 

To Henry, it seemed like the world was just putting pressure on him from all sides, with nobody, nowhere, and nothing to turn to. He didn't want to go on like this.

His parents cared very much about Henry, and noticed that he'd been acting strange lately. He'd been appearing sleep deprived, his grades were faultering, he'd started neglecting personal hygiene, and become apathetic towards everything, including previously prized possessions. Henry's parents were very concerned about him. They contacted his friends, and they all said the same thing, that he'd been acting out of the ordinary lately, and they were also all concerned for him.

Despite being underage, he aquired a few cases of whiskey and drove to a local bridge above a river. He sat there for hours, sipping on whiskey, procrastinating when to end all the pressure on his life. 

His parents noticed that he'd been missing for longer than usual. He was 17, and on any other night they'd just assume he'd be out doing whatever teenagers do, but this time they knew something was wrong, they could *feel* it.

They searched the entire city for hours, until they found him, with an empty bottle of whiskey in his car, and him standing over the edge of the bridge.

They saw the signs, and they didn't need any further evidence beyond where he was and what he was doing. They didn't waste a moment before grabbing him and bringing him back onto the road. They both hugged him like they would never see him again, because they almost wouldn't. Had they found him a minute later, they would have found him dead. 

""Henry, my boy, we know that you're stronger than this. Ever since the day that you were born, when I looked at you, I saw someone who could take on the world."" His dad told him

""You are strong. We know that you'll be okay. You may feel like these are the worst days of your life, and they may be, but in the future you'll see how amazing life can be, and you'll regret ever considering taking your own."" Said his mother.

The next morning they brought him to a therapists office with all of his friends there too. They helped him through these times and supported him through recovery. His parents talked with his teachers and many of them completely re-evaluated their homework policies for their entire classses, and some made a few exceptions specifically for Henry, considering his situation and the fact that many of the teachers already adored him.

His outlook on life improved after several months of counseling. His grades started rising again, and by the end of the school year, he scored a perfect 36 on the ACT, and got a full ride 4 year scholarship to the MIT, since he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. When he brought the good news to his parents, they saw him more excited and happy than he had been since his faling into depression. 

Thanks to loving parents and supportive friends, he was ready to love life and live it to the fullest.",AntiJokes,What stopped the depressed boy from committing suicide?

Preebie,0,/r/AntiJokes/comments/a01h6v/the_red_ribbon_story/,2,"To truly understand this, you must read it carefully. 

Johnny was walking to class one day when he heard some of the other kids talking about the Red Ribbon story. A little confused, but in a hurry to get to class, he decides to ask the teacher what it meant. 

When he gets to class he asks the teacher “ma’am, what’s the red ribbon story?” Suddenly, the teacher gets very angry and tells him to go to the principal’s office. When he gets to the principal’s office, he asks the principal, “I overheard some of the kids at school talking about the red ribbon story, but when I asked the teacher what it was, she told me to come here. What’s the red ribbon story? The principal looks the boy in the eye and says softly, “I’m sorry son, but you are no longer welcome at this school. I’m expelling you.” 

So, Johnny goes home to his mother and he’s clearly distraught. He says to his mother, “Mom, I got expelled from school today.” His mom was surprised. “Why on earth did that happen?” Johnny said, “Well, I overheard some of the kids talking about the red ribbon story so I asked the teacher what it was, and she sent me to the principal’s office and the principal expelled me! Mom, what’s the red ribbon story?” His mom shakes her head sadly. “Go to your room son. Your dad will figure out what to do with you.”

When Johnny’s dad gets home, he asks Johnny to recount the days events. Johnny says slowly, “Well, I heard some kids talking about the red ribbon story, so I asked the teacher what it was. She sent me to the principal’s office and then the principal expelled me. Then, when I asked mom, she grounded me! Dad, please, what’s the red ribbon story?” Dad looks Johnny in the eyes for a moment and says, “Johnny, get out of this house and don’t you ever come back.” 

Johnny was horrified. At nine years old, he’d been kicked out of his house and expelled on the same day. However, Johnny was a tenacious kid, and these events only made him more determined to figure out what it was. He started running down the street quickly. 

That’s when he got hit by a car.

The moral of the story? Always look both ways before you cross the street.

Also, studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive function and decrease the risk of depression. However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled or espresso) has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels. In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart disease in people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine in the body. So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk. Although coffee may have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that other beverages, such as milk and some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your coffee adds fat and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.

Rotation occurs at all scales, from the motions of electrons in atoms to the motions of entire galaxies. We need to develop some general methods for analyz- ing the motion of a rotating body. In this chapter and the next we consider bodies that have definite size and definite shape, and that in general can have rotational as well as translational motion.

Real-world bodies can be very complicated; the forces that act on them can deform them—stretching, twisting, and squeezing them. We’ll ignore these deformations for now and assume that the body has a perfectly definite and unchanging shape and size. We call this idealized model a **rigid body.** This chapter and the next are mostly about rotational motion of a rigid body.

We begin with kinematic language for *describing* rotational motion. Next we look at the kinetic energy of rotation, the key to using energy methods for rota- tional motion. Then in Chapter 10 we’ll develop dynamic principles that relate the forces on a body to its rotational motion.",AntiJokes,"What do the motions of an airplane propeller, a Blue-Ray Disk, a ferris wheel, and a circular saw blade all have in common?"

So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

xevetv,1,/r/AntiJokes/comments/9vrx7h/why_cant_penguins_fly/,0,"Well they fly through water if that means anything...  

Penguins have strong wings and strong pectoral muscles to power them.  Their bodies are streamlined as if for flight, so they still cut cleanly through the water. But water is much thicker than air, so their  wings are shorter and stiffer than a normal bird’s wings. In fact,  penguins are the **only birds** that are unable to fold their wings. Their  wing bones are fused straight, making the wing rigid and powerful, like a flipper.

By the same token, penguins aren’t nearly as concerned about being  light as birds that fly through the air. To dive deep, to catch fast-swimming prey, and to survive frigid temperatures, their bodies have huge fat supplies, heavy muscles, and densely packed feathers.  There’s no way they could fly with such short wings and heavy bodies.

Penguins are an interesting example of specialization versus  compromise. By giving up on flight they’ve been free to evolve bodies that perform superbly underwater. Some birds, like the murres and guillemots of the Arctic can still fly, just not as well as some other birds; and they can also swim, though not as well as penguins.",AntiJokes,Why can't penguins fly?
