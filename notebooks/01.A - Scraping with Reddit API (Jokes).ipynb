    "_This notebook is dedicated to collecting data from the Reddit API. For this specific project, I have decided to compare the two subreddits, /r/Jokes and /r/AntiJokes. The motivation for choosing these two subreddits is twofold: one, to see if I can use machine learning classification models to distinguish if a post if from one of the two subreddits and two, to begin thinking about whether or not humor is something that can be reduced to an algorithm of word counting. I realize that the second goal is extremely lofty and is way beyond the scope of this project, but I hope to gain even a little bit of insight._ "
